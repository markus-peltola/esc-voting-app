# Eurovision Song Contest Voting App

This is a quick and messy training project for learning Svelte made with "vibe coding". So in no way is it built with best practices in mind.

Project's goal was to do a simple tool for me and my friends to have a playful fantasy league and our own voting for the ESC.

I went with ease-of-use in mind and thus scrapped authentication altogether. The app currently fulfills it's purpose for me so it's considered done for now.

## Future

If at some point I want to learn more Svelte, I will probably clean this project up and maybe add some more fetures. Before that, do not judge too harshly the quality of the project ;)
